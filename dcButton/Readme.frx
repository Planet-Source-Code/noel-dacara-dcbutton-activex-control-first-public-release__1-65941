ˇçI created this control to test my programming skills with APIs, particularly to discover how broad it was

I tested almost any possible defects I can imagine to ensure that the control will work fine & efficient

You may read History.txt to view the coding history down from the very start, you may find it useful for your own controls or when creating new usercontrols

Mac button styles were based only on images I have seen on a magazine so there is really no guarantee that it will look the same, infact I don't have any experience on Mac systems or even seeing it in person

And I can't assure that the control will be free from defects, if you find some please let me know about it

Although I have said that the control will run on Win95 & later, I can't confirm it now, only on WinXP

I will appreciate if you will send me your comments, suggestions, or reactions, especially your votes :)
