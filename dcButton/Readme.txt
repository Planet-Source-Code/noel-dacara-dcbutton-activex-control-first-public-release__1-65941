I have created this control for my own personal use with the aim of imitating only the regular xp button.

But that was before I was inspired by the success of other well-known buttons like laVolpe and chameleon then I started adding more button styles that I saw on some magazines and computer programs like the Windows® Explorer, Microsoft® Office XP and 2003, and the Opera® Browser which I really don't have any permission at all. Sorry.. :)

I used only snapshots of the said programs using the PRINTSCREEN button to get their screenshots and then finally getting idea on how to draw them using API's so there is really no guarantee that they will look exactly the same as expected but I'm trying my best.

And take note, unlike any other controls, my source has the flexibility if I may call, to easily exclude some codes particularly button style drawing procedures & some features that are not needed on compilation so that the programmer can save some extra space consumed by the control on the final executable of a program. See usercontrol file for more info.

Now, I'm sharing the control to everyone for personal and educational use only with/without permission from the author (ahem...) provided that you'll give me my credits for developing this control. About using this button for commercial applications or the like is a bit different thing and needs some additional stuffs, any donation/promotion would do I guess...for now :)
