    <td><p>I need help! Bug problem. As I was correcting the MDIChild bug issue reported by ubt1 and seems to have corrected it, another problem occurs, crash problem! As I analyzed my code, I find nothing that could interrupt or cause the subclasser to get into trouble. It went all fine until terminating (or unsubclassing) the WM_NCACTIVATE message I added to subclass the parent form. I tried almost anything until I got a crazy idea of why not testing the subclass examples itself provided by Paul Caton on his SelfSub v2.1 submission particularly the pSample.vbp project on \Samples\uSelfSub\Simple directory.</p>
      <p>The following are the steps seconds from disaster :)</p>
      <p>15. Add MDI form to the project then set it as the Startup object.<br>
        14. Set the existing fMain form to be its MDIChild.<br>
        13. On MDI Form_Load() procedure I added the line &quot;fMain.Show&quot; (without the quotes of course) only.<br>
        12. I test run it and it went fine.<br>
        11. Next I forgot, on the uSample.ctl usercontrol code particularly on the UserControl_ReadProperties() procedure...<br>
        10. I added the line &quot;sc_AddMsg .hwnd, &amp;H86&quot; (without the quotes) as the last code inside the UserControl.Parent WITH structure<br>
        09: By the way, &amp;H86 is the API constant value for WM_NCACTIVATE<br>
        08. The procedure should look like this below:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p> Private Sub UserControl_ReadProperties(PropBag As PropertyBag)<br>
          #OTHER CODES TRUNCATED#<br>
          <br>
          With UserControl.Parent<br>
          sc_Subclass .hwnd<br>
          sc_AddMsg .hwnd, WM_MOVING<br>
          sc_AddMsg .hwnd, WM_SIZING<br>
          sc_AddMsg .hwnd, WM_EXITSIZEMOVE<br>
          sc_AddMsg .hwnd, &amp;H86 ' WM_NCACTIVATE<br>
          End With<br>
          <br>
          End Sub</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>07. Then I run it again. It went fine again! (Almost losing hope, I got another hint.)<br>
        06. I created another instance of the uSample usercontrol on the fMain form.<br>
        05. I run it again and close the form by form's close button or the MDI's close button but still it went fine.<br>
        04. Got really prostrated, I added another instance of the uSample usercontrol on the fMain form.<br>
        03. The form (fMain) now contains a total of 3 uSample usercontrol objects.<br>
        02. Now I run it.<br>
        01. It went fine again!!!<br>
        00. Feeling really helpless, I closed the MDI form using the close button of the MDI form. Got yah!!! VB crashes!!!<br>
        <br>
        I open it again and follow the same steps again to be sure that I wasn't having mistakes and still it crashes.<br>
        <br>
        Now I'm quite confident that it wasn't my code that causes the ugly crash. The subclasser itself has the problem.<br>
        I need help from Paul Caton who is the original author of the great self-subclasser or anyone who can to solve this problem.</p>
      <p>And hey before I forgot, previous versions (not sure what version) of Paul Caton's subclasser does not experience this problem.<br>
        <br>
        To make things easier, I incuded the sample project on this submission. It is located on the <a href="SelfSub/">this</a> folder.<br>
