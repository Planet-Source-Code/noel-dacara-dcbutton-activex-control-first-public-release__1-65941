    <td><p>This is not really a bug reporting format, it just a sort of like that :)<br>
      Anyway, some bug reports are good but some are not that really good.<br>
      I have a hard time fixing some of them because I can't and I don't know how to find them because of less information.</p>
      <p>It may be hard to believe  but I have  made the control as much as possible free from those frequently reported 'Subscript out of range' error, some possible crash occurances, program hung or halting, and something like the recent Redim array errors  and more except for those usercontrol drawing problems which are really a bit tricky and adventurous to discover and I don't understand why and how  it causes to occur on other systems.</p>
      <p>I am using Windows&reg; XP Professional SP2 operating system with Visual Basic 6.0 SP6, and I don't encounter these errors on the control even before.<br>
        I admit that I encountered  error 9 'Subscript out of range' once but I have fixed it and fortunately it never comes back.<br>
        I tested it uncompiled and tested it compiled for the assurance and I did fix the problems for good.</p>
      <p>I just need more details when reporting serious problems like crash problems or something better than worst, please take time to include how you got the problem to occur and if possible make it step-by-step. Also if you think its necessary please state your OS version and VB programming environment version which can be a clue on solving specific problems.</p>
      <p>Example 1: My system crashes when I placed the button on another usercontrol. I'm using Win98 with VB5.<br>
      Example 2: 'Subscript out of range' error when I set the button to crystal style and resize it. I'm using VB6.</p>
      <p>I really appreciate bug reports from everyone and I like fixing them no matter what, hope you understand my point about these.<br>
        Okay, enough of this boring discussion. Until your next bug report, thanks for reading, see yah!<br>
