Did you know that?

-The ColorTheme property of the control is changing only the
 button's BackColor. The control will do the rest of the job
 in calculating colors for different parts and state of the button
 which is a great benefit for everyone having hard time doing this.

-You can modify different color attributes for the button
 aside from the color properties available in the property browser
 and the default colors automatically defined by the control.
 You can do by using the OverrideColor procedure of the control.
 Usage of procedure constants may differ from different button styles.

-If you set an icon/picture larger than the control's drawing area,
 the control will attempt to crop the image so that it will only
 draw part of the image that is visible on the control which can help
 to make thinks faster when using large images/bitmaps.

-If you set an icon as the control's normal, hot, or down state picture
 and set UseMaskColor to False, the control will (attempt to) use the
 top-left pixel color of the icon to set transparent areas of the icon.

-You can view useful descriptions assigned to every public properties
 and procedures of the control on the object and property browser of
 the vb ide. This information is what some custom control lacks of
 when distributing their compiled versions or source projects.
 This descriptions can be a great help not only for newbies but also
 for everyone new to the control. Every custom control developers
 should practice providing these descriptions for the benefit of us.
