        Very nice control. 5 from me.<br>
        I have found an error in sub PolylineEx<br>
&quot;subscript is out of range&quot;, because Points=nothing, it is at the beginning, I have put &quot;On error resume next&quot; and it works fine.</strong></p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p>Fixed (Hopefully..) using my way first. Please test it for me, coz' I really don't know when this occurs.<br>
        But if this error still occurs, the alternate solution would be placing the &quot;On Error Resume Next&quot; instruction on the procedure at the moment as Carlos' suggested.<br>
        And please kindly inform me when or how this error occurs coz' I rarely get this error and seems to appear only on some systems, coz' it does not appear on mine :)</p></td>

        Looks gr8! Can the Crystal style be made smooth on edge?</strong></p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>It's a bit complicated but I think I can do that. But...it may take an additional resource &amp; time from the system because it will still have to get the image behind the control inorder to blend it with, which I think is the only way we can make the edges real smooth.<br>
      Another way, like what I have currently updated to the control is to remove the focus border showing the control in focus. It should look good now but not that good. The downside is that you can no longer determine (visually...) what control is currently in focus unless you remember it.<br>
      Got any other idea? or suggestion? Please tell me, I would be glad to try it :)</td>

      Works great until you start changing the font size.<br>

  <tr>
    <td>So I see the problem, but only if the text/caption is long enough to exceed the control's boundary/size.<br>
      What happens here is that the text/caption is still being centered between the picture and the edge of the button.<br>
      So I got it now, the text should not overlap the picture and this is what it happened here.<br>

      Excellent !<br>
      The big worry about these sort of buttons are consumes system resource. Lack of intelligence. I mean drawing should not happen for hidden/minimized forms.<br>
      Try 100 buttons in a form check loading and unloading speed. If it is still cool.. That is it..<br>
      Hope this control will pass the test.<br>
      All the best.</strong></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p>Was it consuming more system resource? Hmm don't think so :)<br>
        Was it drawing on hidden/minimized forms? Yes it should! Why? I'm not sure but it should.<br>
        Take this for an example, Have you ever used the LOAD command?<br>
        LOAD FORM1 instruction loads &amp; draws FORM1 on memory so when the time you call FORM1.Show, the form shows immediately.<br>
        Got the point? The technique is usually used for implementing splash screens to load the main screen in background.<br>
        Well...that should explain why controls must allow to redraw even when their parent form/window is hidden or minimized.<br>
        And about the 100 button statement, well all custom buttons/controls do have/experience this disadvantage I think and unfortunately there is only one solution to the issue for me, don't use it!<br>
        Instead, just stick using the standard command button your whole life hehe :) peace.</p></td>

      hi Noel A. Dacara<br>
      Most of my Video Projects are with &gt;50 buttons in single form. Like Mini Control Panel.<br>
      Some time I prefer Buttons than Menus. Which is more convenient for New PC Users.<br>
      I have very bad experience with most of these buttons. But I like urs. It is very fast and taking less resource.<br>
      But I could not use it, because of many bugs.<br>
      Thanks again for sharing.</strong></td>

    <td>Yah you're right, most new pc users prefer buttons than menus.<br>
      Don't worry I'll be trying my best to make this control solid proof and free from bugs as possible because I'm gonna use this also on my own applications.<br>
      Anyone can help me with this, especially you, but finding for bugs and more suggestions is what I prefer most. Thanks again. </td>

      Hi, very nice button control. 5 stars from me...<br>
      A little modification could be made to the position of the Picture and the Text, when the Picture is on top of the text a space would be nice between the picture and text. It looks very cramped as it currently is.</strong></td>

        Little Bug: When disabling button by itself (by clickking it), picture doesn't change to disabled.<br>
        Also all other graphic effects doesn't draw. So we have a disabled button that looks like a normal button.<br>
        You can see this very clear on a WindowsXP button.<br>
        Example: need one button (TestButton) with this code...<br>
        Sub TestButton_Click()<br>
        TestButton.Enabled = False<br>
        End sub<br>
